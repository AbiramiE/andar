This page explains the structure of the project's sources.


= Details =

The source code repository contains three Eclipse (Galileo) projects. Those are:
 * AndAR
   * Currently *under development*.
   * Will have a pure Java API to the ARToolkit.
 * AndOpenGLCam
   * My first try to get the ARToolkit working on Android.
   * Should basically work.
   * There is no real API in order to replace the cube with something else, you would have to edit the C source code.
   * Will be *deprecated* as soon as the AndAR project advances.
 * AndObjViewer
   * A app to view [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obj wavefront obj] 3d models
   * Has *nothing* to do with the Augemented Reality stuff.
   * Is *not* needed when you would like to run one of the other projects.

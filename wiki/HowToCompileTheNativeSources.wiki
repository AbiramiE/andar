 # Install the android [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html NDK]
 # (windows only) Install [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin]
 # Open the Cygwin shell or some other shell on a linux system
 # Make a symlink from your eclipse project folder (should be called AndOpenGLCam) to the ndk apps folder 
 # change line 2 of Application.mk to APP_PROJECT_PATH := $(call my-dir)
 # in the root of the NDK folder run make APP=AndOpenGLCam
 # refesh your project in eclipse
 # If everything went smoothly your libs folder will have the .so files that jni needs

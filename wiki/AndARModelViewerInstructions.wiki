 * You need to install the OI File Manager, though the app will automatically point you to this app in the market.
 * Print out the [http://andar.googlecode.com/files/Android.pdf marker], upon which the models will be projected.
 * Download obj model files to your sdcard, e.g. the model of superman:(you must download both files)
   * [http://andar.googlecode.com/files/SupermanSmall.mtl superman obj file]
